Q1-Describe three collision resolution strategies not mentioned here.

A1-Hopscotch Hashing

Robin Hood hashing
2-choice hashing: Uses two different functions as well as linked lists to
  determine a place in the hash table. when a node is sorted the algorithm puts
  the node at what ever bucket has the fewest nodes, defaulting to the first
  function if there are equal nodes on both linked lists.

Coalesced Chaining- here each bucket holds a value and a next value to point
  to an alternate position incase of collision. when there is a collision the
  algorithm starts at the bottom of the hash table and looks for the first
  open index to put the entry, it then updates the original index's next value
  to point to the new position.
