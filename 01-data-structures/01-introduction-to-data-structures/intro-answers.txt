Q1- How does your data structure allow developers
    to access and manipulate the data?
A1- in all three of the tested files there are instance variables
    enable a developer to access pertinent data from the code.

Q2- If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your
    data structure, how would you search for it?
A1- The answer to this question would vary depending on which file
    you are searching. Both screen.rb and line.rb have specific
    functions for searching for elements, or you could write a
    block to iterate over some of the array objects.

Q3- What other real-world data can each structure represent?
A3- I could imagine using a similar data structure to represent 
    people in a line to buy season tickets for a event, this could be
    hooked up to a if loop where if they do not keep up on dues they
    are dropped from their spot. To add to this analogy one might use
    the scree.rb data structure to display who is in what seat where
    the outer arrays are the rows and the inner arrays are the
    individual seats, one more outer set of arrays could represent
    sections.
