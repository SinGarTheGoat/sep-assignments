Q2- Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your
    HashClass may be a poor idea.

A2- When an arrays size is doubled this forces the program to
    iterate over more indices and increases the search and load
    time for arrays. Indices in arrays must be stored in memory
    sequentially, making large arrays more taxing on the system.
