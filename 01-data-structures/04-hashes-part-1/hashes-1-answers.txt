Q2- Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your
    HashClass may be a poor idea.

A2- When an arrays size is doubled this forces the program to
    iterate over more indices and increases the search and load
    time for arrays. Indices in arrays must be stored in memory
    sequentially, making large arrays more taxing on the system.

    rather than doubling an array it is better to use the next prime
    number greater to better affect the modular and more randomly
    rehash the array.
