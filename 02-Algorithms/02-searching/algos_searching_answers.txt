Q1- Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many
    iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
A1- 7 iterations.

Q2- Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many
    iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
A2- 3 iterations.

Q3- Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.
A3- fib(10)= 55, fib(11)=89, fib(12)=144


_________2nd part________

Save the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence above as
fibonnaci_recursive.rb. Compare the time it takes to run fib(20) between
the iterative solution from the previous checkpoint and recursive solutions.

the iterative is MUCH FASTER.
iterative fib 20       0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000016)
recursive fib 20       0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.002834)

Q1- Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you
    choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative
    or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
A1- I would use a linear search because the collection is unsorted and unsuitable
    for a binary search, I would also use iterative search because it is faster
    and simpler for just iterating over an object.

Q2- Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you
    choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative
    or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
A2- I would use a binary search because the collection is sorted and would
    almost definitely be faster, I would also make it recursive to handle the
    constant halving of the collection.

Q3-Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.
  fib(10)=55
  fib(11)=89
  fib(12)=144
