Q1-Describe three collision resolution strategies not mentioned here.

A1-Hopscotch Hashing

Robin Hood hashing

2-choice hashing: Uses two different functions as well as linked lists to
  determine a place in the hash table. when a node is sorted the algorithm puts
  the node at what ever bucket has the fewest nodes, defaulting to the first 
  function if there are equal nodes on both linked lists.
